Sub-contract of DDXF series, a standard proposal to combine off-chain access-token (tokenization) with on-chain token (assertization). Provides support for data management, esp., the permission control. This contract is a basic version for DToken, which cannot be retransferred. For the rest DToken contracts, which support OEP8.


==Motivation==
Capitalize tokens on the basis of data tokenization, and use blockchain technology to realize the generation, transfer and transaction of capitalized tokens. This OEP is an OEP8-type asset support for DToken.
